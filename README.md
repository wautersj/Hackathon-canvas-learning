# Session 1: Basics

Introductions. Basic use of Canvas. Building a frames handler and create a simple visualisation.  
Play with settings to achieve different results.


# Session 2: Particle Emitters

Building a simple particle emitter where particles react to gravity. Lastly we'll make the
emitters dynamically set, so we can generate more of them.


# Session 3: Space Invadors

Creating the Space Invadors mini-game. Keyboard interactions to manipulate a canvas, using the
canvas frame rate to our advantage, and implementing simple collision detection.
